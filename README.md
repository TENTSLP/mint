# Mint, an TENTSLP Management Suite

## Create and control your TENTSLP Tokens in your browser

_Mint is client-only: the app runs in your web browser. Mint uses rest.tent.app as the default back-end, but the user may select any backend. Mint is non-custodial and does not have access to your private keys. You must back up your wallet to recover your funds._

- Mint (create additional token supply for tokens without fixed supply)
- Send & Receive TENT and TENTSLP tokens
- Import existing wallets
- Choose your own REST API (default: rest.tent.app)
