# Mint, an TENT Tokens Management Suite

## Create and control your TENT Tokens in your browser

_Mint is client-only: the app runs in your web browser. Mint uses rest.tent.app as the default back-end, but the user may select any backend. Mint is non-custodial and does not have access to your private keys. You must back up your wallet to recover your funds._
